## Task: Redo the deployment and document it
CHALLENGE

That was quite the process!

Hopefully you are starting to see why documentation is so important in Operations, DevOps and similar.

Redo the deployment of the app, this time documenting along the way.

Remember to include:

- Headings
- Numbering, bullets, bold
- Screenshots
- Code blocks

An example of how it should be structured and what is should include can be found here [here](https://qat.com/writing-deployment-support-requirements)

This guide should allow someone to pickup the guide having not worked on the development of the app, and get it deployed to the VM on EC2

Push to GitHub when you are done

## Optional task:
CHALLENGE

Try to automate the deployment of the Sparta app using a bash script.
