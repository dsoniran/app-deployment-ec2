## Database Options Challenge

Today we will be extending the functionality of the application we deployed yesterday.

We will document the process LATER, as we did yesterday. Before we start with the depolyment, your task is a small research task to gain understanding of the role of a database and the various types that are available.

### Your Task
Research relational and non-relational databases, and address the following points
- What is the structure of the database
- When would this database by used
- Explain a comparison of the two as well as examples of these databases



The format of this challenge can be a notes.md file that you populate with your findings
