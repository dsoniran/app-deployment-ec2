1. OPTIONAL - Create and test your own app and database images, if you do not have them available yet.
- Do DB first
  - Remember to enable Mongodb
- App second
  - Do not try to automate the running of the app, do that in user data
2. Centralise and complete your documentation of what you have covered this week
- Host on GitHub
- Use subfolders preferably 
- ensure the documentation is usable by others and of a standard that would impress industry professionals
- If/When done Upload your repo in the submission page provided.
- We will aim to review your documentation as soon as we can and provide feedback

From here everything is optional, below are some ideas on what to have a go at:

OPTIONAL - Look into Docker and containerisation
- How does it work? What are containers?
- Can you run a piece of software as a container?
- Can you "containerise" the sparta app?
- Can you host the image file on DockerHub?
- Can you use Docker Compose to spin up both the app and the database in separate containers, and connect them?

OPTIONAL - Develop a website or web app and deploy it on AWS/Azure/GCP using the techniques we have learned this week
- If you have something already why not deploy that
- Follow the full SDLC stages: Plan, Code, Build, Test, Deploy, Monitor
- Document the process to add it to your portfolio
- Try implementing CI and/or CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins etc.)
- Containerise your app?
- Feel free to submit your documentation in the page provided

Reminder: Cloud Networking skills sprint starts on Monday the 24th of November.

It will cover:
- VPCs
- Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform
- Ansible (maybe!)

Feel free to research these if you want a head start! See you there.
